# TFL-Crowding
Website to view TFL crowding using TFL API

A webpage to view the crowding at London
Underground (‘tube’) stations by weekday.

Webpage shoul show a greeting level-1 header to the users. There should then be a
drop-down choice to choose the tube station. There should then be a drop-down choice
to choose the day of the week. Then, when the user clicks a button, they should be able
to see a bar-chart of the crowding (as a percentage of total station occupancy) on the
y-axis and time-bands (i.e., 15 minute intervals) on the x-axis. Below this the AM peak
time frame, and PM peak time frame, should be noted. Below this there should be a
table showing the crowding in 15-minute increments.
